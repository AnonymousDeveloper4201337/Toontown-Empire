# Repo Rules and Regulations:

We make dev changes to develop, but before we release: if the develop branch is stable, merge it into the production branch. This is the branch used for hosting the game on the server and the branch used for deploying to the server with a stable game.

Do not push broken code to the develop branch, because it messes up the game and makes it harder for the developers to add features, and fix bugs in the game! When you revert something broken, please post the crash to make life easier for the coders.

# Compilation Branch Rules and Regulations:

Do not edit, append or sync the "Compilation" branch, this branch is setup to cater for a automated compiler I'm developing.
Anyone who breaks this rule will be removed from the team with no mercy or second chances.

Pushing to this branch will automatically compile the game into a .EXE on Dubito's Compilation Server. Then, it will instantly be available on the website. (www.toontownepire.com/dubito/compilations/<version>-<buildtype>.EXE)
Access is restriceted by a admin password.
