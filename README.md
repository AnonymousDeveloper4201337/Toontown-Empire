# Repo Rules and Regulations:

When adding commits; do not push to master unless the code is tested and fully functional.



#BUGS in This Branch to be fixed before merge with master
[*] ~maxToon Command currently does not work
[*] Cog Buildings cause a crash sometimes due to monobots (Cant work out how to stop this happening)


#To Do
[*] Once finished testing change percentages for monobot spawns to be better instead of 8-% in DDL and 5% in other places this needs to be balanced (@Malverde will sort this before pushing to master)
[*] Cog textures need changing to new cogs im guessing someone will be making the new textures??
[*] If someone knows how to make a new cog icon .bam and make a new cog icon for the cog type that would be good too.
